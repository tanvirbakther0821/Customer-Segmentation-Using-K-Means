# Customer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer behavior using unsupervised learning methods and segment them into meaningful groups. The goal is to help retail or e-commerce businesses create targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer experience, and optimize product offerings based on cluster-specific characteristics.

We used K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to categorize customers based on demographic and behavioral data.
